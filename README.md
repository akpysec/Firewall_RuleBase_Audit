## Description

Rule Base Audit was designed by security consultants/auditors. It is meant to provide a security-oriented view of the IPv4 Rule Bases from various type firewalls (Tufin, FortiGate, Palo-Alto, Checkpoint & More). Once consultant exported IPV4 policy in .csv or .txt format, all auditing checks may be performed offline.

The project team can be contacted at <scoutsuite@nccgroup.com>.

### Types of Checks Supported

Currently the following checks are supported:

- Broad assignment with object "Any" within Source / Destination / Service fields
- Disabled rules
- No Log rules
- Crossed rules (Two-way rules)
- Worst rules (rules with multiple findings)

## Usage

Rule Base Audit is run through the CLI:

Once this has completed, it will generate an .xlsx report including findings:

The above report was generated by running Rule Base Audit against dummy files from https://github.com/akpysec/RuleBaseAudit/tests.
